#SudokuWeb
This is a port of my SudokuSolver project from a JavaFX desktop application to a JavaScript web app.

Also a work in progress, currently this is the bare minimum worth checking in. It has a model layer with comprehensive unit tests, and a HTML rendering layer that can produce an initial unhinted SUdoku diagram.

The project uses node, npm, React, babel with react and es2015 plugins, jest, CommonJS modularisation. My first significant JavaScript project so reviewers shoudl treat it kindly :)
